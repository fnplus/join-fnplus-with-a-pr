# fn+geeks community

Our sole mission is to help you recognize your potential :muscle: and purpose :musical_note:. We believe that everyone has a gift in himself or herself but are not able to see it. We will help you in every possible way. Just ask us! :heart_eyes: 

Some of our core beliefs are:

* Assist others in realizing their highest potential.
* To provide a safe environment for the free exchange of ideas.
* Reduce the amount of time you spend seeking and instead spend more time studying, talking, and interacting.
* To build a community where everybody, regardless of where they live on the planet, may participate.

## Request for Proposals

If you are interested in learning about something, you can also submit a Request for Proposal (RFP). This helps identify areas where the community as a whole would like to learn about specific topics. This makes it easy for other individuals who have expertise in the topic to submit a proposal that might address this need.

The [Proposals](https://github.com/fnplus/join-fnplus-with-a-pr/blob/master/PROPOSALS.md) page also has information on how to submit RFPs.
